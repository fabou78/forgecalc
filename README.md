> Yet **another** tool for the "Forge of Empires" game by InnoGames  

## Description

This is a simple Web App with a few tools to simulate Forge Point (FP) investment on a Great Building (GB) both from the owner and investor perspective and with some additional tools specific to the guild I am with at the moment ``Intrepid Ones``.
The app is accessible at the following link [fabou's forgecalc](https://fabou78.github.io/forgecalc/) and a short description of the tools available is listed bellow;
* ``SECURE PLACE`` - This tool will simulate your potential investment on a GB by letting you know how much you should invest to secure a particular place into someone else GB. It will also let you know if you would be loosing or gaining some FPs.
* ``PROFIT CALC`` - This tool will let you know when a partical slot (place) in your own GB is profitable or not based on a potential investor with an Arc at least @ level 80. Right now the app is not yet able to tell you how much you should put on your own GB to make a particular slot profitable for an potential investor (it might be in the future).
* ``FASTTRACK V1`` - The aim of this tools is to speed up leveling of GB, it will give the owner a view of how much FP is required to allow other players in the guild to help out.  Investors will make profit base on their Arc level and an Arc @ level 60 minimum is required to make profit. It is important to note that in this version it is the responsiblity of the **owner to secure the place** before an investor can invest and that the particular place will be open for someone outside the guild until the investor put the required FPs.
* ``FASTTRACK V2`` - Same as above except that this time, it is the investor that secure his place and the ower now pays back the investor loss (if any) + some extra into a GB of the investor's choice
* ``GUILD ARC STATS`` - This tool give a quick view of the Arc situation in the guild I am in

> Both of the Fasttrack tools are made to help out younger player (and more) to speed up GB leveling. It requires generosity from guildmates as well as owner having some (possibly consequent) FP in their inventory.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
