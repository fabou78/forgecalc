> Some explanation on how 1.9 thread works in Intrepid Ones

## Summary
The 1.9 thread will be an exclusively non-profit thread that will allow GB owners to get extra FP from investors owning an Arc80. The investors will pay in the full FP amount + their Arc bonus (x1.9) gained from the transaction making zero profit.


## Responsibility

* ``Owner`` - Before posting his GB, the owner **MUST** ensure that an investor’s place(s) is/are secured and can’t be taken over by someone else. This is accomplished by the owner adding FP to his own GB until it reaches a safe level. Depending on GB level and place posted, adding FP to own GB might or might not be required

* ``Investor`` - The investor **MUST** ensure that he can’t be sniped before investing the required FP. This can be simulated but using the link belowThe below links can be used for this


## Risk
There is a risk that someone outside the guild takes a place intended for a guild member and not put the extra x1.9 (sniping). In order to reduce this risk, this owner is **STRONGLY** advised to check if there are any guild Arc80 owners online before posting. The Arc80 owners that have generously accepted to help are listed [here](http://fabou78.pythonanywhere.com/arcstats/)  with a “1.9” next to their names.


## Challenge for our Guild:
We are a small guild with a small number of Arc80 players and to make matters worse, most of us are spread over the globe in different time zones. We will need to be forgiving if things don’t go as expected.

## How does 1.9 thread compare to fastrack thread?
Fasttrack would cost a bit more to the owner but will give an opportunity to get something back from the investors (BP, FP medals). Investors make profit in fasttrack but not in 1.9 thread where they only increase their BP and medals. Both are aiming to speed up GB levelling.
